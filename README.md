# Two-period Stochastic Programming model

In brief, the model determines optimal buy/sell decisions given initial holdings. 

This is done by simulating scenarios for all considered assets and selecting the decisions that maximize the expected utility of the new holdings that the decisions correspond to

For a background on the theory behind the model, see for instance [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221719300153?casa_token=dUruyqP4QkkAAAAA:EDwqnQ-ZLdKj-0yUOSxeqkzQTg-D-RgGgoS2LGHGwAGD-CwZr_piqCIn_dmyt8AXJoSY9fqSVA](this article).

The model is still a work in progress, and does therefore very likely contain bugs.

The decisions are optimal given the defined model, and always suboptimal in real life. I do not take any responsibility for potential unwanted investing outcomes as a result of using this model
